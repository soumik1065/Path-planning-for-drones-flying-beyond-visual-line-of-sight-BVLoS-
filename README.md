This project aims to improve the safety and efficiency of UAV operations conducted beyond the operatorâ€™s direct visibility, which are vital for applications such as infrastructure inspection, agriculture, disaster management, and delivery services. The work focuses on developing a risk-based path planning framework that generates grid-based risk maps by considering factors like no-fly zones, population density, sheltering conditions, obstacle heights, and probabilities of crash, impact, and fatality. Implemented through simulations in urban, sub-urban, and rural regions using a C program, the study revealed that the sheltering factor is the most critical parameter, with higher shelter values (e.g., buildings) reducing risks, while open areas exhibit the highest risks. The results show that effective BVLoS operations require not only robust navigation technologies but also comprehensive risk evaluation strategies. This project provides a foundation for advancing safer BVLoS drone missions, with future work focusing on dynamic risk assessment under real-time conditions.
